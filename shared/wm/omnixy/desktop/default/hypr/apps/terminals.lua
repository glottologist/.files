-- Define terminal tag so themes and bindings can single terminals out. Omnixy
-- launches TUIs and its own terminal windows under dedicated app-ids
-- (org.omnixy.btop, org.omnixy.terminal, TUI.float, ...), so match those too.
-- The class is matched in full, so foot's other app-id needs spelling out.
